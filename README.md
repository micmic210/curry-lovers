### Design
#### Color Scheme

The “CURRY LOVERS” website utilizes a warm and earthy color palette that reflects the rich and hearty nature of curry dishes.
The dominant color, #D77921, is a vibrant orange that evokes the warmth and spice of curry, making it ideal for capturing the essence of the brand. Complementing this are the deep, chocolatey brown tones of #3A2A2A, which add a sense of richness and depth to the design. The darker gray hues, #3A3A3A and #505050, provide a strong, neutral foundation that balances the more intense colors, while #696969 offers a softer contrast. Finally, the light gray #F9F9F9 serves as a clean and minimal backdrop, ensuring readability and a modern aesthetic. Together, these colors create a cohesive and appetizing visual experience, perfectly suited to a website dedicated to curry lovers.

#### Typography

The Curry Lovers website features Poppins for headings, adding a modern, elegant touch that elevates the overall design. This font choice contributes to a clean, contemporary look, perfect for showcasing the website’s vibrant content.

![poppins-title](/documentation/poppins-title.webp)

Roboto is used for body text, ensuring excellent readability across all devices. This versatile font complements the Poppins headings, making the content easily accessible and visually appealing. Both fonts are particularly well-suited for food-related designs, enhancing the inviting nature of the site.
